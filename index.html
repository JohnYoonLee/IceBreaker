    <h2> Why are the glaciers melting? </h2>

        <p>
            The main reason the glaciers have been melting is thanks to human activities. 
            With the primary culprit being the industrial revolution. This was the starting
            point of a giant spike in greenhouse gas emissions that have caused an overall increase
            in the earth's temperature causing the ice to start melting.
